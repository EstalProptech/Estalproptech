# ✅ Deployment Error Fixed - Ready to Deploy

## 🎯 Problem Identified and Solved

### ❌ The Error You Encountered

```
ERROR: 42601: syntax error at or near "/"
LINE 1: /supabase/functions/server/database-setup.sql
```

### 🔍 Root Cause

You attempted to paste the **file path** (`/supabase/functions/server/database-setup.sql`) into the Supabase SQL Editor instead of the **file contents**.

The SQL Editor can't execute a file path - it needs the actual SQL code from inside the file.
