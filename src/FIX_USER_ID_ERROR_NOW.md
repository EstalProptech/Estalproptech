Creates a **VIEW** called `user_profiles` that reads from your KV store, allowing all your RLS policies and queries to work correctly.

## ðŸ†˜ Still Getting Errors?

### Error: "relation kv_store_96250128 does not exist"

Find your KV store table name:
```sql
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename LIKE 'kv_store_%';
```

Then edit line 22 of the SQL file to use that table name.

### Error: "permission denied"

Run this:
```sql
GRANT SELECT ON user_profiles TO authenticated, anon;
```

- [ ] Query `SELECT * FROM user_profiles` without errors
- [ ] Query `SELECT * FROM properties` without errors

## ðŸ”‘ Key Insight

Your app stores users in a **KV store** (key-value store), not a traditional SQL table. The fix creates a SQL **VIEW** that makes the KV store queryable like a table, so all your existing code works without changes.

**Time to fix:** 3 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Copy + Paste  
**Risk:** None (view creation is safe)  

ðŸš€ **Just run the SQL and you're done!**
